    "### 1. String:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A string is a sequence of characters enclosed within single quotes (' '), double quotes (\" \"), or triple quotes (\"\"\" \"\"\").\n",
    "- Strings are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed once created.\n",
    "- They support various string-specific operations like concatenation (+), slicing ([]), and string methods for manipulation.\n",
    "- Example: **my_string = 'ArewaDS'**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. List:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A list is an ordered and mutable collection of elements enclosed within square brackets [ ].\n",
    "- Lists can contain elements of different data types and allow duplicates.\n",
    "- They support various operations like appending, removing, slicing, and modifying elements.\n",
    "- Example: __my_list = [1, 'apple', True, 3.14]__\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Tuple:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A tuple is an ordered and immutable collection of elements enclosed within parentheses ( ).\n",
    "* Tuples can contain elements of different data types and allow duplicates.\n",
    "* They are similar to lists but cannot be changed once created (immutable).\n",
    "* Example: **my_tuple = (1, 'banana', False, 2.71)**\n",
    "### 4. Set:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A set is an unordered and mutable collection of unique elements enclosed within curly braces { }.\n",
    "- Sets do not allow duplicate elements and automatically eliminate them.\n",
    "- They support set operations like union, intersection, difference, and more.\n",
    "- Example: __my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}__\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strings are sequences of characters and are immutable.\n",
    "- Lists are ordered, mutable, and can contain duplicates.\n",
    "- Tuples are ordered but immutable; they can contain duplicates.\n",
    "- Sets are unordered, mutable, and contain only unique elements; they don't maintain order and do not allow duplicates."
